## Update Defective Case Dataset
The current SOP for recording defects at final inspection dictates that only cases found to have defects are recorded in Final Inspection Dataset. A limitation was discovered: as instances where items run without defects are not recorded, gross percentage defective calculation (average defect performace of all instances of an item) is often far higher than it should be. Using a historical dataset of all production instances of an item, identify which JobItem events have not been recorded (due to lack of defects discovered) and update current dataset to include these 0% defective instances.
